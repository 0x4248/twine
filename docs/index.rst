   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to twine's documentation!
=================================

Twine is `a utility`_ for interacting with PyPI.

Currently it only supports registering `projects`_ and uploading
`distributions`_.

The goal is to improve PyPI interaction by improving security and
testability. Ideally, ``pip`` and ``twine`` will merge into a single
tool.

Please see `the GitHub repository`_ for code and more documentation,
and the `Python Packaging User Guide`_ for user documentation. You can
also join ``#pypa`` or ``#pypa-dev`` `on Freenode`_, or the `pypa-dev
mailing list`_, to ask questions or get involved.
